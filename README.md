# `storycraft`: Craft your scientific story

During your last scientific meeting, how many talks could you follow from bagining to end? I bet your answer is much lower than ALL. If specialists can't allways follow other specialists, how can scientists persuade the general public or politicians? To improve we should use the oldest and most powerful tool for effective and persuasive communication, the story.

`storycraft` shows how to craft a scientific story, combining advice from some books and papers about writing and storyteling. It should be useful for any type of scientific communication, such as, writing papers, oral presentations and media releases.

### State of this repository

Now, `storycraft` has nothing to download but has accummulated some [issues](https://github.com/maurolepore/write/issues) that provide a good idea of its content and direction. I look forward to finding other scientists interested in this project. Ideas and support are welcome.

## Some books that inspired me are these:
