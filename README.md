# `write`

`write` privides a process to writing a paper, step by step, combining advice from different sources on writing and storyteling including these books:

- [Style: Lessons in Clarity and Grace](https://www.dropbox.com/s/2r7q3g3f0j7cw1v/Style%20Lessons%20in%20Clarity%20and%20Grace%20%2811th%20Edition%29.pdf?dl=0)

- [Writing Science: How to write papers that get cited and proposals that get funded](https://www.dropbox.com/s/1f33njoshllujd8/Writing_science_Schimel_2012.pdf?dl=0)

- [The Art of Scientific Storytelling: Transform Your Research Manuscript using a Step-by-Step Formula](https://www.amazon.com/Art-Scientific-Storytelling-Step-Step/dp/0615821995)

This repo starts on February 2017 and should evolve forever. At any point, it aspires to be my template for writing papers.
